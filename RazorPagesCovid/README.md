#### Introduction - Project Description

Project goal was to create a Web Test Framework and test (using SpecFlow and Page Object Models) the RazorPagesCovid website.
Each test should correspond to a user story and scenario, annotating which user stories or scenarios were missing.  Create a defect report for each defect you find.
Meet periodically with the Developer team, whose work you are testing, to triage defects and report missing user stories/scenarios. Added the defects and missing requirements to the project boards.  Once fixed, the tests can be performed again and close or reopen the defect.

### Download Visual Studio
